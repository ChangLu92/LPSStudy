How the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (e.g. a number of biological factors and unhealthy lifestyles) affect the activities of circulating monocytes, one of the most important cell types in CVD, remains unclear.

This study is to examine the impact of CVD risk factors on monocyte transcriptional responses to an infectious stimulus.
