In this study, we found diastolic blood pressure levels were negatively correlated with the monocytes’ response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, suggesting that high blood pressure may weaken the response of monocytes to an infectious stimulus in CAD patients.

•	The attenuated LPS responses in monocytes of CAD patients seem to be associated with diminished inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.
•	The antihypertensive drug iloprost may reverse this attenuated LPS response in monocytes of CAD patients with high diastolic blood pressure.
